# Excel-TableCornerLabels  
Adds the ability to split a cell along the diagonal in order to show labels for both the column header and row header.  

![Example1](Example1.png)


Install
-------

The only file you need to download is `CornerLabels.xlam`.  If you also download `Install.bat` into the same directory, you can double-click on `Install.bat` to copy `CornerLabels.xlam` into `"%appdata%\Microsoft\AddIns\"`.

To enable the add-in:
1. Open Excel and select a blank workbook (or any workbook).
1. Click the __File__ tab, click __Options__, and then click the __Add-Ins__ category in the left pane of the Excel Options dialog.
1. In the __Manage__ dropdown box, select __Excel Add-ins__, and then click __Go__.  This will open the Add-ins dialog and close the options dialog.
1. In the __Add-ins available__ list, select the check box next to __Cornerlabels__, and then click __OK__.


Usage &nbsp; &nbsp; ![icon](/CustomUI/images/icoAddEdit.png)
-----

You will now have a new section on the __Home__ tab bar called __Diagonal Split__ containing an __Add/Edit__ button.

It is best to add the split cell after you have set up your column and row headers.  This is because the split cell will default to using the formatting from those headers.  However, you can use the Copy buttons within the Add/Edit dialog to copy the header formatting later.
